/** @mainpage
 * Welcome to the <b>MNX Document Model</b>.
 *
 * Use the <b>navigation buttons</b> at the top of this page to browse through
 * the framework documentation.
 *
 * The MNX Document Model is a <b>C++ class framework</b>
 * around the MNX music interchange format, which uses JSON files.
 * It requires the C++17 standard or higher. (It is currently tested with C++23.)
 * 
 * Features include:
 * - Implemented with an underlying nlohmann JSON document. No class-level serializing to/from JSON is required.
 * - Lightweight class definitions contain only the shared JSON document and a json_pointer to the object. (See @ref mnx::Base.)
 * - Validation routines for both the MNX JSON schema and semantic validation.
 *
 * Member functions for each MNX entity are defined using macros that create the boilerplate for the definitions.
 * For example, `MNX_REQUIRED_PROPERTY` creates a getter (equal to the property name) and a setter (`set_` followed
 * by the property name). The boilerplate macros are defined in `BaseTypes.h` and have extensive documentation in the comments.
 *
 * A key feature of this DOM is that MNX-required children and properties must be supplied when an object is constructed
 * from scratch. They can be subsequently changed if need be. Many classes have `Fields` types (with `from(...)` helpers)
 * to facilitate passing all the required data for a child object.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * mnx::sequence::Event evt(seq, "content");
 * evt.ensure_duration(mnx::NoteValue::from(NoteValueBase::Quarter, 1));
 *
 * auto note = evt.ensure_notes().append(mnx::sequence::Note::from(
 *     mnx::sequence::Pitch::from(NoteStep::C, 4)));
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning Avoid using references for instances returned by the methods in this library. Because classes are so lightweight,
 * all methods return temporary copies. Using a reference on a temporary is undefined behavior.
